Datasets are refreshed nightly. The order doesn't matter too much since we do it in the middle of the night, but we have ordered the refreshes by dependancy. 
For example, we refresh the notifications before the services so we can be confident that if we have the notification in QuickSight then we have the corresponding service as well.

All times are UTC.
