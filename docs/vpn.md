# VPN and Internal Tools

## Overview

GC Notify is moving towards using a VPN to access internal tools and perform administrative tasks. This increases security, and ease of use for connecting to our various utilities. 

## Setup

### Pre-Requisites

[Download and install the AWS VPN Client](https://aws.amazon.com/vpn/client-vpn-download/)

### Profile Setup

Each environment has its own VPN, and thus you must set up 3 VPN profiles. Repeat the following steps for each environment.

1. Navigate to the [AWS Console](https://cds-snc-ct.awsapps.com/start#/)
2. Log in to the account for the environment you would like to set up
3. Search for "Client VPN Endpoints" or once you've done the above, simply [click here](https://ca-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=ca-central-1#ClientVPNEndpoints:)
4. Select the radio button beside the only available endpoint
5. Click the "Download Client Configuration" button at the top right
6. Open the AWS VPN Client
7. Choose File -> Manage Profiles
8. Click "Add Profile"
9. Provide a display name - the name of the environment is recommended ex "Notify Staging"
10. Click the folder button and select the previously downloaded VPN Client Configuration
11. Click Done


## Tools Currently Available

Currently Blazer and Hasura are the only tools available under the VPN, but more will follow. Additionally you can directly connect to redis and postgres but this is obviously not recommended in production.

Connecting to redis and postgres directly would be using their respective CLI from your local machine

Redis:
``` shell
redis-cli -h notify-dev-cluster-cache-az.<amazon-generated>.amazonaws.com -p 6379
```

Postgres:
``` shell
psql  -h notification-canada-ca-dev-cluster.<amazon-generated>.rds.amazonaws.com -p 5432 -U username notificationcanadacadev
```

### Important Notes

- The internal DNS for each environment is not a standard DNS and thus will not be resolvable
without connecting to the appropriate VPN. 
- You MUST connect to the corresponding environment VPN to reach that DNS (ex staging for *.staging.notification.internal)
- Since the DNS is not standard, you MUST enter the https:// in the URL (at least the first time you navigate to it), or else you will be sent to search results. Bookmarking sites is recommended for ease of use.
- The SSL Certificate for these internal addresses is a self-signed certificate. You will have to accept and continue when you are warned about insecure connections.
